bailey.js
=====
bailey.js is a pragmatic language that compiles to javascript. Sort of like coffeescript, but a lot more inspired by python than ruby, with a focus on creating a cleaner, saner language with less flaws.

bailey.js is currently very, very work in progress, with lots of stuff missing. But if you want to check it out, see the language in `example.bs`, and convert it to js with the following command:

`node bailey.js example.bs > example.js`
