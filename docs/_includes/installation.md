## Installation
Assuming you already have [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), installation is as easy as:

{% highlight bash %}
  $ npm install bailey -g
{% endhighlight %}

This installs it globally, but of course you can put it in your project's package.json manually or by running `npm install bailey --save`.
